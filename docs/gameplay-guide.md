# Gameplay Guide

**Mekha Puli** is a 2-player local pass-and-play strategy board game.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Role Selection
1. **Player 1** starts the game and is presented with role selection
2. Choose either:
   - 🐐 **Play as Goats** - Control 5 goats trying to trap the tiger
   - 🐅 **Play as Tiger** - Control the tiger trying to capture goats
3. **Player 2** automatically gets the other role

### Step 2: Understanding the Board
- **10 nodes** arranged in a triangular pattern (4 tiers)
- **Nodes** are connected by lines showing legal movement paths
- **Tiger** starts at the top (apex) node
- **Goats** will be placed during the game

### Step 3: Turn Indicator
The HUD at the top clearly shows:
- **"Your Turn"** with green indicator when it's your turn
- **"Waiting..."** when it's the other player's turn
- Current game phase and instructions

## How to Play

### Phase 1: Goat Placement (Goat player places pieces)

#### Goat Player's Turn:
1. Look at the HUD - it will say "Place a goat (X/5 placed)"
2. Tap any **empty node** on the board
3. A goat 🐐 will appear at that position
4. Pass the device to the Tiger player

#### Tiger Player's Turn:
1. Look at the HUD - it will show your move options
2. **Legal moves** are highlighted in yellow on the board
3. You can either:
   - Tap an adjacent empty node to move there
   - Tap a node 2 steps away to jump and capture a goat
4. Pass the device to the Goat player

**Phase 1 continues** until all 5 goats are placed on the board.

### Phase 2: Goat Movement (Both players move their pieces)

#### Goat Player's Turn:
1. Tap one of your goats 🐐
2. **Legal moves** for that goat are highlighted in yellow
3. Tap an adjacent empty node to move the goat there
4. Pass the device to the Tiger player

#### Tiger Player's Turn:
1. Your tiger 🐅 is already selected
2. **Legal moves** are highlighted in yellow
3. Tap where you want to move (adjacent) or capture (jump)
4. Pass the device to the Goat player

## Winning the Game

### Tiger Wins 🐅
The Tiger player wins by **capturing 2 goats**.
- Captures happen when the tiger jumps over a goat to an empty node
- The jumped goat is removed from the board
- Counter shows "Goats Captured: X/2"

### Goats Win 🐐
The Goat player wins by **trapping the tiger** so it has no legal moves.
- Strategically position goats to block all tiger's possible moves
- Tiger must have no adjacent empty nodes AND no capture opportunities

## Tips for Players

### For Goat Players:
- Don't place goats too close together early - they can be captured
- Try to surround the tiger gradually
- Use all 5 goats strategically
- Block escape routes before closing in

### For Tiger Players:
- Stay mobile - don't let goats surround you
- Look for capture opportunities when goats get close
- Control the center of the board when possible
- Remember: you only need 2 captures to win!

## Game Controls

- **Tap/Click nodes** to place goats or move pieces
- **"New Game" button** in HUD to restart anytime
- **Legal moves** are always highlighted when it's your turn
- **Console log** shows all actions (for debugging)

## Pass-and-Play Etiquette

1. **Wait for your turn** - check the HUD turn indicator
2. **Pass the device** after each move
3. **Be sportive** - no peeking during opponent's turn planning!
4. **Celebrate together** when someone wins

Enjoy the game! 🎮
